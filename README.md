# Communication-Autoencoder
Reimagining autoencoders as communication systems. 

## Communication Systems Overview 
In essence, any communication system is comprised of a transmitter, a channel and a receiver.

Mathematically, any communication system can be discribed by using the following formalism. The transmitter wants to transmit a uniformly chosen message 
S, such that 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$S&space;\in&space;\mathcal{M}&space;=&space;\{1,....,M\}$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$S&space;\in&space;\mathcal{M}&space;=&space;\{1,....,M\}$" title="$S \in \mathcal{M} = \{1,....,M\}$" /></a>,

in n discrete uses of the channel. To this end, the transmiter generates a lower level representation of message S (i.e., converts the message S with size M to a message T with size n). The communication rate of the system is R = k/n [bits per channel use], where 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$k&space;=&space;\log_2&space;M$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$k&space;=&space;\log_2&space;M$" title="$k = \log_2 M$" /></a>.

The transmiter imposes a power constraint on the message T (per bit, or on average), and the message T is then transmitted over the channel. The channel is corrupted by Gaussian noise. The ratio between the input power and the power of the Gaussian noise is called the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As a result of the channel noise, the receiver receives a distorted version of the message T, denoted by T'. The receiver generates a higher level representation of message T' (i.e., converts the message T' with size n to a message S' with size M) and decodes the transmitted message. 

## Communication Systems Revisited 

This project, mimics a communication system with an autoencoder in TensorFlow. Autoencoders are neural networks that aim to copy their input to the output, by placing the input as a target label. The input layer, of size M, is a one-hot representation of the message S. The first hidden layer, of size n, creates a lower level representation of S. The output of this hidden layer is then corrupted by Gaussian noise and is used as an input to the second hiddel layer of size n. The output layer, of size M, is a higher level representation of hidden layer 2. The decoded message is found as argmax(output layer).

The adopted metric is the bit-error-rate (BER), which quantifies how many bits on the output message differ from the bits of the input message. For higher SNR the BER is lower, and conversly, lower SNR means higher BER. For high enough SNR, the BER should be zero.

## Prerequisites 
The code requires TensorFlow and numpy.
